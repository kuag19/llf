<h1>London Logic Forum (LLF)</h1>

<p>The London Logic Forum brings together London researchers in the mathematics and computational aspects of formal logic. It promotes informal contacts between them, and works with them to support visits, visitors, and PhD students. It also publicises and hosts relevant seminars and workshops.</p>

<p>In recognition of the now substantial research activity in logic in the capital, the London Logic Forum was formed in 2004 by members of Birkbeck College, Imperial College London, King's College London, and University College London. The <a href="people.html">people</a> participating in LLF have research interests in algebraic, first-order, modal, temporal, intuitionistic, spatial and description logic, and other relevant areas including combinatorics, complexity, model theory, knowledge representation and reasoning, and automated theorem proving.</p>
