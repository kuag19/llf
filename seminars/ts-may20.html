<h3>Axioms for relational signatures containing demonic composition</h3>

  <p>
Most natural signatures of relation algebra do not give finite
  axiomatisations, but there are some exceptions. One is algebras of
  relations under ("angelic") composition and the inclusion order as
  ordered semigroups, as shown by Zaretskii in 1959. We give a
  "demonic" conterpart to this, involving demonic refinement rather
  than inclusion. There are negative results for the signatures of angelic composition and demonic refinement as well as for demonic composition and inclusion.
  </p>

  <p>
  Another important operation is domain. The relational signature of
  domain plus demonic composition is finitely axiomatised as left
  restriction semigroups (just like the functional case), but when
  demonic refinement (or equivalently in this case, inclusion) is
  added, there is no finite relational axiomatisation. On the positive
  side, we give a finite axiomatisation for the very closely related
  relational signature of domain restriction, demonic refinement and
  demonic composition. (In the functional setting, both these
  signatures give finite axiomatisations.)
