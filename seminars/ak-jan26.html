<h3>Axiomatising 2D representable diagonal-free strict cylindric
  algebras<br />
  (aka Non-finitely axiomatisable 2D modal product logics
with infinite canonical axiomatisations)</h3>

<p>
Joint work with Christopher Hampson, Stanislav Kikot and and S&eacute;rgio Marcelino
</p>
<p>
It is well-known that the equational theory of the class <i>RDf<sub>2</sub></i> of
2D representable diagonal-free cylindric algebras (the algebraic
counterparts of two-variable substitution and equality free 
first-order logic) is decidable and have a finite canonical 
axiomatisation. On the other hand, for <i>n>2</i> the equational theory 
of <i>RDf<sub>n</sub></i> is not only non-finitely axiomatisable, but it does not 
have a canonical axiomatisation (where each equation is canonical), 
even if it is itself canonical and r.e. (though undecidable).
</P>

  <p>
We study here a `strict' version of the cylindrifications over
binary relations that correspond to the `elsewhere' quantifier in 
first-order logic (and so the related `rectangular' and `square' 2D 
representable classes both have decidable equational theories).
We show that both the `rectangular' and `square' versions of 
2D representable algebras of this kind behave unlike <i>RDf<sub>n</sub></i>
(for <i>n>2</i>), rather like <i>Crs<sub>n</sub></i>
  (<i>n</i>-dimensional cylindric
  relativised set algebras) in the sense that they are non-finitely 
axiomatisable, but have nice infinite canonical axiomatisations.
  </p>

  <p>
All results can also be presented in the 2D modal product logics
  setting. The corresponding modal logics are the first examples of
  non-finitely axiomatisable 2D modal product logics
with infinite canonical axiomatisations, where
  the component logics are finitely axiomatisable.
