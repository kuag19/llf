<h3>Logical Foundation of Spacetime</h3>

<p>Foundation of Mathematics bulletinboard 
(<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/">FOM</a>, December 2003 - February 2004)
contains several postings by Harvey Friedman in which he proposes to
export the methodology, spirit, and machinery of Foundational Thinking
from the area of Foundations of Mathematics to a similar foundation of
relativity which eventually would "cover" both special relativity and
general relativity. Of course, one begins with special relativity (but
keeping in mind the direction of general relativity). We will give an
overview of this kind of research going on at various parts of the
globe. Material on this:<br />

<p>
Special relativity emerges as a rather transparent, simple and
self-evident theory  <i>SPECREL</i>  of first-order logic (FOL). A natural,
logical procedure called localization can be applied to  <i>SPECREL</i>
yielding the more flexible  FOL-theory <i>Loc(SPECREL)</i>. The latter is
"local" in the sense of general relativity.  <i>Loc(SPECREL)</i>  can be
regarded as a starting point for building up a FOL-theory of general
relativity. Looking at this with the logician's eye, we note that
obtaining such FOL theories (and proving their adequateness etc) is only
the beginning of a logic-based conceptual analysis (and, in general,
foundational thinking for) relativity and not the end.
</p>

<h3>Logic, relativity theory, closed timelike curves ("time-travel")</h3>

<p>
<i>No familiarity with general relativity will be assumed in the talk.</i>
</p>

<p>
Besides  FOM |--&gt; Foundation of Relativity mentioned in the previous
talk we mention 3 further kinds of connection between logic and
relativity.
</p>

<p>
(1) Beginning with Kurt G&ouml;del's spacetime, there is a family of
spacetimes in which closed timelike curves (CTC's) occur. Intuitively,
CTC's make time-travel to the past possible. These lead to interesting
logical puzzles (since they invoke something like self-reference).
However, in logic we have a ready-made machinery for handling
self-reference. We will conclude that the alleged logical "paradoxes of
time-travel" can be resolved by logical means showing that there are no
logical reasons excluding time travel. See:
<br />

</p>

<p>
(2) Examples of spacetimes milder than the ones in item (1) above make
it possible to design relativistic computers which can compute
non-Turing computable functions. Cf. 
<a href="http://www.math-inst.hu/pub/algebraic-logic/turing.pdf">Etesi-N&eacute;meti</a> and/or <a href="http://www.math-inst.hu/pub/algebraic-logic/Hogarththesis.ps.gz">Hogarth</a>.
Tipler in his 1974 book, in section G, arrives at similar conclusions,
using general relativity in a similar fashion. This is a connection in
the Logic &lt;--| Relativity direction. One of the key ideas of these
relativistic computers is that they do NOT involve knowing things like
in what state my computer is after having performed an infinite number
of steps.
</p>

<p>
(3) The spacetimes in (1) include G&ouml;del's one, Kerr one, Kerr-Newman
one, Gott's one, van Stockum - Tipler one, to mention a few. All of
these involve rotation of that gravitating matter which is the source of
the gravitational field we are studying. The time-orientation of the
CTC's under discussion also can be regarded as a kind of "rotation". We
will look at the question of whether these two kinds of  rotation are
connected to each other, e.g. whether it is a logical necessity that
they "move" in opposite directions.                      
</p>


<h3>On definability theory of first-order logic</h3>

<p>
We will see two first-order logic (FOL) theories  <i>T1</i>  and  <i>T2</i> such that
<i>T1</i>  is definable over  <i>T2</i>  and  <i>T2</i>  is definable over  <i>T1</i>, but they are
not definitionally equivalent.
</p>

<p>
We use the following definitions: <i>T1</i>  is said to be definable over  <i>T2</i>
if  <i>Mod(T1)</i>  is a reduct of a definitional expansion of  <i>Mod(T2)</i>.
Further,  <i>T1</i>  and  <i>T2</i>  are said to be definitionally equivalent if they
have a common definitional expansion.
