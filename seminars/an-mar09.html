<h2>Hajnal Andr&eacute;ka and Istv&aacute;n N&eacute;meti</h2>

<h3>Back and forth between logic and relativity theory</h3>

<p>
Actually, we will touch upon more fields than the mentioned two, e.g.,
cosmology, black holes and wormhole theory will be brought into the picture.
</p>

<p>
In particular, we will show how one can build up relativity theories
(including general relativity and cosmology and Einstein's E=mc2) purely
within logic, as theories in the sense of logic, and with no other
prerequisites than some familiarity with the basics of logic. This will
provide, as a byproduct, a logic based foundation for relativity (in analogy
with the foundation of mathematics) as well as a conceptual analysis for
relativity theories. Further, it will provide a gentle (and streamlined)
introduction to relativity for the questioning mind or for the logically
minded.</p>

<p>
In the other direction, general relativity leads to hyper computation which
in turn can be brought to be relevant to logical issues like Hilbert's
programme. As a second feedback to logic, in analyzing relativity theory,
we get motivation for elaborating definability theory in the direction of
defining new sorts, or new universes of new entities as opposed to defining
only new relations on old entities.
