<h3>Undecidability of two-variable intuitionistic and modal predicate logics</h3>

<p>Ever since the undecidability of first-order classical logic became known,
there has been a continuing interest in establishing the `borderline' 
between
its decidable and undecidable fragments. One approach to this 
classification
problem is to consider fragments with finitely many individual 
variables. The
borderline here goes between two and three: the two-variable fragment of
classical first-order logic is decidable, while with three variables it 
becomes
undecidable.</p>

<p>As classical first-order logic can be reduced to intuitionistic first-order
logic by G&ouml;del's double negation translation, the three-variable 
fragment of
the latter is also undecidable. We solve a long-standing open problem by
showing that, unlike its classical counterpart, already the two-variable
fragment of first-order intuitionistic logic is undecidable, even without
constants and equality. We also discuss similar questions about modal 
predicate
logics.</p>

<p>This is joint work with Roman Kontchakov and Michael Zakharyaschev.</p>
