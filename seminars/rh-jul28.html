<h3>The temporal logic of two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is decidable</h3>

<p>
Joint work with Mark Reynolds.
</p>
<p>
We consider Minkowski spacetime, the set of all point-events of spacetime under the relation of <I>causal</I> accessibility. That is, <I>x</I> can access <I>y</I> if an electromagnetic or (slower than light) mechanical signal could be sent from <I>x</I> to <I>y</I>.
</P>

  <p>
We use Prior's tense language of <B>F</B> and <B>P</B> representing causal accessibility and its converse relation. We consider two versions, one where the accessibility relation is reflexive and one where it is irreflexive.
</p>

  <p>
  In either case, it is not known if the logic is decidable or even
  axiomatisable and this has been an open problem for decades. We make
  a small step forward by proving, for the case where the
  accessibility relation is irreflexive, that the set of valid
  formulas over two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is decidable;
  decidability for the reflexive case follows from this. The
  complexity of either problem is EXPTIME at worst.
  </p>

  <p>
  We provide a temporal formula that distinguishes between
  three-dimensional and two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and
  another temporal formula that distinguishes the two-dimensional case
  where the underlying field is the real numbers from the case where
  instead we use the rational numbers.
