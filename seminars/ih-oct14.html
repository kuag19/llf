<h3>Some developments in the modal logic of space</h3>

<p>
This year is the 70th anniversary of the appearance in the Annals of Mathematics of a seminal paper by McKinsey and Tarski, called "The algebra of topology". 
</p>
 
<p>
In that paper, the authors studied a mathematical model of space.  Formally, they considered an arbitrary separable dense-in-itself metric space.  Such a space is rather abstract, but also rather general.  Many common examples are covered, including the real line or plane, ordinary 3D or higher-dimensional space, the rational line, toruses, and so on. 
</p>
 
<p>
The authors introduced a modal language for describing such spaces.  The language is simple and not hugely expressive, but it can express many basic spatial arguments.  In a famous and sophisticated result, the authors showed that the logic of every separable dense-in-itself metric space is S4.  This gives us a rigorous foundation for correct spatial reasoning in this language.
</p>

  <p>
  Without going into details, I will describe in a fairly general way McKinsey and Tarski's original 1944 result, and a few of the developments since then - including joint work with Goldblatt earlier this year on extensions to the modal mu-calculus and languages with the [d]-operator and the universal modality.
