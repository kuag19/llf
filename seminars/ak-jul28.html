<h3>The decision problem of modal product logics with a diagonal, and faulty counter machines</h3>

<p>
Joint work with Christopher Hampson and Stanislav Kikot.
</p>
<p>
In the propositional modal (and algebraic) treatment of two-variable
  first-order logic equality is modelled by a `diagonal' constant,
  interpreted in square products of universal frames as the identity
  (also known as the `diagonal') relation. Here we study the decision
  problem of products of two arbitrary modal logics equipped with such
  a diagonal. As the presence or absence of equality in two-variable
  first-order logic does not influence the complexity of its
  satisfiability problem, one might expect that adding a diagonal to
  product logics in general is similarly harmless. We show that this
  is far from being the case, and there can be quite a big jump in
  complexity, even from decidable to the highly undecidable. Our
  undecidable logics can also be viewed as new fragments of
  first-order logic where adding equality changes a decidable fragment
  to undecidable.
</P>

  <p>
  We prove our results by a novel application of counter machine problems. While our formalism apparently cannot force reliable counter machine computations directly, the presence of a unique diagonal in the models makes it possible to encode both lossy and insertion-error computations, for the same sequence of instructions. We show that, given such a pair of faulty computations, it is then possible to reconstruct a reliable run from them.
