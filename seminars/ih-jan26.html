<h3>A shorter proof that <i>wRRA</i> is a variety</h3>

<p>
The class <i>wRRA</i> of "<i>weakly representable</i>" relation algebras was introduced by J&oacute;nsson in 1959.  It is the class of all relation algebras that have a representation (an embedding into an algebra of binary relations on some base set) that respects all the relation algebra operations (including boolean meet) except perhaps boolean join and complement - even though these operations are present in the algebra. 
</P>

  <p>
In Problem 1 of his 1959 paper, J&oacute;nsson asked implicitly whether <i>wRRA</i> is a variety - axiomatisable by equations.  (His explicit question concerned algebras without join and complement.)  For <i>wRRA</i>, this was answered positively by P&eacute;csi in 2009.  His proof used reduced products, and was short.  I will give a similar proof, using compactness, that seems to be even shorter.
