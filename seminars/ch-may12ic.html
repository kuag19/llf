<h3>Undecidable products involving the logic of 'elsewhere'</h3>

<p>
(Joint work with Agi Kurucz)
</p>
  <p>
The modal logic of 'elsewhere', or the difference operator, Diff is known to be Kripke complete with respect to the class of symmetric, pseudo-transitive frames; frames not too dissimilar to equivalence relations. Indeed the validity problems for both Diff and S5 are in co-NP.
</p>
  <p>
Products logics of the form L x S5 are usually decidable and S5 x S5 even enjoys the finite model property. In contrast, we present some cases where the transition from L x S5 to L x Diff not only increasing the complexity of the validity problem, but in fact introduces undecidability. In addition, we also show that Diff x Diff lacks the finite model property.
</p>
  <p>
The strategy we use for demonstrating undecidability involves a reduction from the non-halting problem for 2-counter Minsky machines, whereas typically, previous strategies in this area have involved Turing machines or grid-tiling problems.
